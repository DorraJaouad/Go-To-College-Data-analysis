Forecasting the decision to go to college

##Introduction
This project was made in order to forecast the decision of youth in the US about pursuing studies in Universities. I used High school student data related 
to the decision to go to college in order to create a mathematical approach to forecast the decision of a student to go to college and that will be based 
on quantitative and qualitative metrics ( e.g: gender, parent salary ... )

#modelGTC.py it includes the script for transforming the data in order to match the decision tree data modelling requirements. It works on random basis 
and machine learning . At the end of the script, you will find a Viz of the tree generated at that seesion.

#GoToCollege.py : After creating the data model for forecasting now it is time to implement it. This file is a UI where the user can inputs the details needed to calculate
the decision output.
PS/ I am still working on the group mode :)
